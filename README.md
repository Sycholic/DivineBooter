# DivineBooter

Hello.
This is the private version of DivineBooter I made public because yes.
I think I am going to commit this very frequently. So...
well Minecraft protocol is sooo strange... and I think
I'll literally have some crisis while developing anti-bots' bypasses...

OLD README OF OLD PUBLIC REPOSITORY:
A simple and efficient Minecraft Booter.

After studying Minecraft's protocol I wanted to try to code it out by making a Minecraft Booter.

NOW, AS ALWAYS, I WILL CONTACT YOUR MOM AND DO ;))) IF YOU STEAL OR EVEN ATTEMPT TO STEAL THE CODE (for intellectuals: don't skid). SAID THIS ENJOY THE PROGRAM EVEN IF IT'S A RAW PROGRAM WITH REALLY SOME COOL FUNCTIONALITIES. VERY RECCOMANDABLE REPOSITORY FOR STUDYING JAVA. HAVE FUN DEAR FOLLOWERS!
